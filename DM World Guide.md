[Work In Progress]

In my head, tone wise, I am thinking of two things for this setting:

Tales from the loop - They are teenagers, adults just don't understand (because mostly dead), weird shit is going on they cannot explain. 

Dragon Prince - Two sides of a story, the humans in the south. The elves and dragon types in the north. Neither really knows what the other is up to, but the other side is the worst. Maybe there is a dragon egg involved, not sure.
