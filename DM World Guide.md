[Work In Progress]

In my head, tone wise, I am thinking of two things for this setting:

Tales from the loop - They are teenagers, adults just don't understand (because mostly dead), weird shit is going on they cannot explain. 

Dragon Prince - Two sides of a story, the humans in the south. The elves and dragon types in the north. Neither really knows what the other is up to, but the other side is the worst. Maybe there is a dragon egg involved, not sure.

What we do know is that Zoroaster was a priest of the pre-Zoroastrian religion of Iran and that he was outraged with his society. Roving bands of drunken warriors would ravage the countryside. They pillaged, tortured, and slaughtered at will. The common people lived in constant fear and misery while the priests obsessed over obscure rituals and sacrifices that offered little guidance or hope to the suffering. Zoroaster couldn’t stand these injustices.

When he was 30 years old, Zoroaster went down to a river to fetch water for a ceremony. There he received a vision from a being of pure light and goodness, Ahura Mazda, who revealed that they were the one true God. The Truth of how the universe worked was revealed to Zoroaster and he knew that it was his divine mission to teach his fellow humans about Ahura Mazda.

So what are the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism? Well.

### 1 Ahura Mazda & Angra Mainyu ### 
Zoroastrians worship one uncreated, and eternal God, known as Ahura Mazda, which means Wise Lord. Zoroaster describes Ahura Mazda as the lord of order, something completely good, loving, infinitely wise and the creator of the world and all good things. Ahura Mazda is supported by six Holy Immortals known as the Amesha Spentas. These six Holy Immortals are normally compared to Arch-Angels in Christanity, if that helps you understand their position a little better. Sometimes there is a seventh Spenta called Spenta Mainyu, but maybe this is also just the Holy Spirit of Ahura Mazda. Sometimes Ahura Mazda has a parent called Zurvan, who is Time itself, but this is considered heresy at this point.

Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu the “destructive spirit” and his evil minions known as daevas. Angra Mainyu is the complete polar opposite of Ahura Mazda. He is darkness, deceit, death, and decay. He is a corrupting parasite seeking to destroy Ahura Mazda's creation and is responsible for all negative things in the world.

Ahura Mazda is light, Angra Mainyu is darkness. Ahura Mazda is the creator, Angra Mainyu is the destroyer. Ahura Mazda created light, fire, compact Japanese vehicles, joy, humanity, puppies probably. Angra Mainyu gave the world disease, rust, mould, darkness, and that little piece of skin that pops up around your nail and hurts so much. WHY ANGRA MAINYU WHY!

Zoroastrians think everything is a battle between these two opposites, Ahura Mazda represents the Truth. Angra Mainyu, the Lie. Human beings need to choose between the Truth and the Lie. Which may be difficult because Angra Mainyu can be very deceiving.

Before time began, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu were separated by an infinite void. They respectively lived in “infinite light” and within “infinite darkness”. Then Ahura Mazda created the physical, or Getig, world. Angra Mainyu crawled into this new world and polluted it. They made the oceans salty, they turned good earth into desert, killed the first human, made plants wither, and polluted fire with smoke.

We now live in a time Zoroastrians refer to as the Gumezishn, the Mixture. Good and Evil, Truth and The Lie, both exist together in our world. But Angra Mainyu’s presence is temporary. They are a stain on the world rather than a permanent fixture. Zoroastrians see the physical world as a trap that Ahura Mazda lured Angra Mainyu into. Now trapped in the physical world Angra Mainyu can be defeated slowly by the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of humans working with Ahura Mazda.

### 2 Heaven and Hell ###
Zoroastrians believe that when a person dies their soul leaves their body. The soul is then led to the Bridge of Judgement. Above this bridge lies heaven, below hell. Here, the soul’s good and bad deeds are weighed on a scale. Depending on the balance of good to evil deeds, the soul ascends to heaven, a paradise of infinite happiness, called the Abode of Song. Or falls down to hell, to suffer quote 'long age of misery, darkness, bad food and the crying of woe'. This is called England….I mean it is called Duzakh.

There is also a Medium Place for people who were neither good nor evil, where they just float and experience nothing.

Zoroaster stated that servants as well as masters, can reach Paradise. People would be judged according to how they had chosen to live their lives, rather than wealth or prestige.

For Zoroastrians death represents the highest form of pollution. Death only exists because of Angra Mainyu. Upon the death of a Zoroastrian, a priest will be called to perform a ceremony. After which the soul of the person will no longer be considered connected to the body. The family then says their goodbyes, without touching the body and the body will be placed on a stone slab carried away by special corpse bearers.

Since dead bodies are so polluting Zoroastrians would never think to pollute any of the sacred elements with it, those being fire, water, earth, etc. . So the traditional method to dispose of bodies, used for thousands of years has been the Tower of Silence. Within these open roofed stone towers, located on top of barren hills, bodies will be laid to rest on stone slabs as to not pollute the earth and then eaten by vultures, normally within a few hours. The bones are bleached in the sun and quickly disintegrate into dust.

### 3 The Apocalypse ###

The battle between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu will continue for thousands of years. But eventually a saviour or saoshyant will be born to a virgin mother who will lead people against the forces of evil and bring about the end times. The Earth will be swallowed by fire, molten metal will cover everything, the good people will pass through this molten river while the bad people will burn and be purified.

The gates of hell will open, the souls will be released and redeemed and everyone will live together in eternal bliss. Honestly it all sounds pretty metal. Angra Mainyu finally defeated by Ahura Mazda and Humanity's Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds will be tossed back into the black abyss they crawled out of and defeated forever. This Last Judgment/Apocalypse is called frashokereti, meaning “renewal.” As in the renewal of Ahura Mazda's originally perfect creation.

### 4 The Three G’s ###

The most important concept in Zoroastrianism after Ahura Mazda, is Asha. This is an ancient Avestan word and is difficult to translate. Asha is truth, wisdom, goodness, justice, perfection, order, and progress rolled into one word. Asha is the path of Ahura Mazda.

Zoroastrians try their best to follow the path of Asha. To help humanity follow Asha, Ahura Mazda gave them Vohu Manah or Good Mind. This allowed humans to recognise right from wrong. Good Mind lets us see injustice and feel that it is unjust. Through Good Mind, Ahura Mazda gave humans free will, this means a lot to Zoroastrians because choice is extremely important to their beliefs.

From our Good Mind we can have Good Thoughts, and from Good Thoughts follow Good Words and Good Deeds. Doing Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds is the core of Zoroastrian belief. 

Good Deeds such as taking part in your community, supporting others during tough times, standing up against injustice, fighting poverty, and nursing the sick all help in the battle against Angra Mainyu. This is why in India Zoroatrians are known for their support of orphanages, shelters, and many charities.

Zoroaster said "Happiness comes to them who bring happiness to others."

### 5 Fire ### 

Zoroastrians see fire as the sacred symbol of Ahura Mazda. It is considered to be pure and represents the Truth. Inside Zoroastrian Fire temples, their priests conduct all rituals in front of fire because it shows the presence of Ahura Mazda. But the fire is never actually worshipped itself. This is very important, Zoroastrians do not worship fire! Zoroastrianism also isn’t a congressional religion, most worship is done at home and Zoroastrians tend to go to Fire Temples only during the 7 Holy Days or festivals they have each year.

The most sacred fires in Zoroastrianism need to be made up of fire from 16 different sources, one of which needs to be ignited by lighting! 

### 6 The Avesta ###

The Avesta is the holy book of the Zoroastrians and one of the world’s oldest scriptures.

It is written in an ancient language known as Avestan which was the language spoken by Zoroaster roughly 3500 years ago.

The Avesta contains hymns from Zoroaster himself known as Gathas. These 17 Gathas are deeply important to Zoroastrians and most Zoroastrian belief is based on them. Due to the violence Zoroastrians have suffered throughout history only a fraction of the Avesta survives today.
