[Work In Progress]

In my head, tone wise, I am thinking of two things for this setting:

Tales from the loop - They are teenagers, adults just don't understand (because mostly dead), weird shit is going on they cannot explain. 

Dragon Prince - Two sides of a story, the humans in the south. The elves and dragon types in the north. Neither really knows what the other is up to, but the other side is the worst. Maybe there is a dragon egg involved, not sure.

What do Emperor Xerxes, Freddie Mercury, and Ireland’s richest citizen Pallonji Mistry
00:17
have in common? All of them are Zoroastrians. The ancient religion of Iran. This is one
00:23
of the oldest ongoing religions and altered the course of history by influencing Judaism,
00:29
Christanity, Islam, and Greek philosophy. But today it has only a fraction of the millions
00:34
of followers it once had. So what is Zoroastrianism, what do Zoroastrians believe, and where do
00:40
otters fit into it? Well Let’s find out.
00:53
Zoroastrianism was born in ancient Iran at least 3,500 years ago. It all began around
01:00
1500BCE give or take a few centuries with the Prophet Zarathustra or Zoroaster as the
01:07
ancient Greeks called him and so English speakers do too. While we call the religion Zoroastrianism
01:13
actual Zoroastrians tend to call it Mazdayasna, meaning Worshipper of Mazda. No not that Mazda,
01:19
but it was named after the Mazda that I’ll explain shortly.
01:23
Zoroastrianism was the chief religion of Iran for over 1000 years. Between the 6th Century
01:29
BCE and the 10th Century CE it was the state religion of 3 huge Iranian Empires. The , of
01:37
300 fame, along with the Parthian and Sasanian Empires.
01:41
Back then the priests of Zoroastrianism were known as Magi. The ancient Greeks thought
01:45
the Magi had secret magical knowledge, since they understood complex astronomy. This led
01:50
to the English words “magic”, “mage” and “magician”. The Magi would even show
01:55
up in the Bible, according to the Gospel of Matthew, 3 Zoroasterian magi came to visit
01:59
the baby Jesus. These 3 wise men as they are known in English are still celebrated by Christians
02:05
worldwide on January 6.
02:08
Eventually the Sassanian Empire would fall to the Muslim Arabs during their invasion
02:12
of Iran in the seventh century CE, which started the decline and persecution of Zoroastrianism
02:17
in Iran. Following this in the tenth century, some Iranian Zoroastrians fled to India, forming
02:23
the Parsi community, named after where they came from, which the Indians called Persia.
02:28
This once refugee community now forms the largest group of Zoroastrians anywhere on
02:33
Earth. And they’ve settled in quite well. One of Indian's largest businesses, Tata Group
02:38
was founded by Zoroastrians and Parsis played a massive role in winning Indian independence
02:44
from Britain.
02:46
Zoroastrians can now be found all over the world. Historically they emigrated to areas
02:50
such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and parts of Africa such as the island of Zanzibar, where
02:55
Freddie Mercury’s Parsi parents would later emigrate from to the UK. In the last 100 years
03:00
small Zoroastrian populations have moved to the UK, US, Australia, and Canada.
03:05
Today there are about 200,000 Zoroastrians. About 60,000 live in India while the second
03:11
largest group of about 25,000 live in Iran.
03:14
With a religion being called Zoroastrianism I think it’s time we talked about Zoroaster.
03:20
We don't know much about Zoroaster's life. We can't even pinpoint when he lived. The
03:24
Greeks thought he lived 6000 years before the death of Plato, so 6347BCEish. While modern
03:33
historians place him somewhere around 1700-1000BCE. During this time the peoples of Iran believed
03:39
in many different gods, some of which were similar to the gods of their ancient Hindu
03:44
neighbours.
03:45
What we do know is that Zoroaster was a priest of the pre-Zoroastrian religion of Iran and
03:51
that he was outraged with his society. Roving bands of drunken warriors would ravage the
03:57
countryside. They pillaged, tortured, and slaughtered at will. The common people lived
04:01
in constant fear and misery while the priests obsessed over obscure rituals and sacrifices
04:06
that offered little guidance or hope to the suffering. Zoroaster couldn’t stand these
04:11
injustices.
04:12
When he was 30 years old, Zoroaster went down to a river to fetch water for a ceremony.
04:17
There he received a vision from a being of pure light and goodness, Ahura Mazda, who
04:23
revealed that they were the one true God. The Truth of how the universe worked was revealed
04:30
to Zoroaster and he knew that it was his divine mission to teach his fellow humans about Ahura
04:37
Mazda.
04:38
So what are the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism? Well.
04:40
1 Ahura Mazda & Angra Mainyu
04:43
Zoroastrians worship one uncreated, and eternal God, known as Ahura Mazda, which means Wise
04:50
Lord. Zoroaster describes Ahura Mazda as the lord of order, something completely good,
04:56
loving, infinitely wise and the creator of the world and all good things.
05:01
Ahura Mazda is supported by six Holy Immortals known as the Amesha Spentas. These six Holy
05:06
Immortals are normally compared to Arch-Angels in Christanity, if that helps you understand
05:12
their position a little better. Sometimes there is a seventh Spenta called Spenta Mainyu,
05:16
but maybe this is also just the Holy Spirit of Ahura Mazda. Sometimes Ahura Mazda has
05:21
a parent called Zurvan, who is Time itself, but this is considered heresy at this point.
05:27
Look we don’t have time to get into it. Honestly it’s a very old religion. There
05:30
have been a lot of different interpretations over the last 3000 years, I am simplifying
05:36
and proving the most common currently accepted beliefs. So keep that in mind, and as always
05:41
there is more information in the description below.
05:43
Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu the “destructive spirit” and his evil minions
05:48
known as daevas. Angra Mainyu is the complete polar opposite of Ahura Mazda. He is darkness,
05:55
deceit, death, and decay. He is a corrupting parasite seeking to destroy Ahura Mazda's
06:00
creation and is responsible for all negative things in the world.
06:05
Ahura Mazda is light, Angra Mainyu is darkness. Ahura Mazda is the creator, Angra Mainyu is
06:11
the destroyer. Ahura Mazda created light, fire, compact Japanese vehicles, joy, humanity,
06:18
puppies probably. Angra Mainyu gave the world disease, rust, mould, darkness, and that little
06:24
piece of skin that pops up around your nail and hurts so much. WHY ANGRA MAINYU WHY!
06:31
Zoroastrians think everything is a battle between these two opposites, Ahura Mazda represents
06:36
the Truth. Angra Mainyu, the Lie. Human beings need to choose between the Truth and the Lie.
06:43
Which may be difficult because Angra Mainyu can be very deceiving.
06:48
Before time began, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu were separated by an infinite void. They respectively
06:53
lived in “infinite light” and within “infinite darkness”.
06:57
Then Ahura Mazda created the physical, or Getig, world. Angra Mainyu crawled into this
07:03
new world and polluted it. They made the oceans salty, they turned good earth into desert,
07:09
killed the first human, made plants wither, and polluted fire with smoke.
07:14
We now live in a time Zoroastrians refer to as the Gumezishn, the Mixture. Good and Evil,
07:20
Truth and The Lie, both exist together in our world.
07:24
But Angra Mainyu’s presence is temporary. They are a stain on the world rather than
07:29
a permanent fixture. Zoroastrians see the physical world as a trap that Ahura Mazda
07:34
lured Angra Mainyu into. Now trapped in the physical world Angra Mainyu can be defeated
07:40
slowly by the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of humans working with Ahura Mazda.
07:46
2 Heaven and Hell
07:48
Zoroastrians believe that when a person dies their soul leaves their body. The soul is
07:52
then led to the Bridge of Judgement. Above this bridge lies heaven, below hell.
07:58
Here, the soul’s good and bad deeds are weighed on a scale
08:01
Depending on the balance of good to evil deeds, the soul ascends to heaven, a paradise of
08:06
infinite happiness, called the Abode of Song. Or falls down to hell, to suffer quote 'long
08:12
age of misery, dark­ness, bad food and the crying of woe'. This is called England….I
08:18
mean it is called Duzakh.
08:21
There is also a Medium Place for people who were neither good nor evil, where they just
08:26
float and experience nothing.
08:28
Zoroaster stated that servants as well as masters, can reach Paradise. People would
08:32
be judged according to how they had chosen to live their lives, rather than wealth or
08:37
prestige.
08:38
For Zoroastrians death represents the highest form of pollution. Death only exists because
08:43
of Angra Mainyu. Upon the death of a Zoroastrian, a priest will be called to perform a ceremony.
08:48
After which the soul of the person will no longer be considered connected to the body.
08:52
The family then says their goodbyes, without touching the body and the body will be placed
08:55
on a stone slab carried away by special corpse bearers.
09:00
Since dead bodies are so polluting Zoroastrians would never think to pollute any of the sacred
09:04
elements with it, those being fire, water, earth, etc. . So the traditional method to
09:10
dispose of bodies, used for thousands of years has been the Tower of Silence. Within these
09:15
open roofed stone towers, located on top of barren hills, bodies will be laid to rest
09:21
on stone slabs as to not pollute the earth and then eaten by vultures, normally within
09:26
a few hours. The bones are bleached in the sun and quickly disintegrate into dust.
09:31
By feeding the birds, the deceased offers up one final good deed of charity before crossing
09:37
of the bridge.
09:38
However in the 1930s, the Iranian government banned the use of the towers and currently
09:43
towers in India are suffering from a shortage of birds due to increased urbanisation and
09:48
pollution.
09:49
Today many Zoroastrian communities use special burial grounds or have turned to electrical
09:54
cremation or even using solar reflectors to harness the power of the sun to break down
10:00
the bodies rather than polluting fire.
10:03
3 The Apocalypse
10:04
The battle between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu will continue for thousands of years. But
10:09
eventually a saviour or saoshyant will be born to a virgin mother who will lead people
10:14
against the forces of evil and bring about the end times. The Earth will be swallowed
10:18
by fire, molten metal will cover everything, the good people will pass through this molten
10:23
river while the bad people will burn and be purified.
10:26
The gates of hell will open, the souls will be released and redeemed and everyone will
10:31
live together in eternal bliss. Honestly it all sounds pretty metal.
10:35
Angra Mainyu finally defeated by Ahura Mazda and Humanity's Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds
10:41
will be tossed back into the black abyss they crawled out of and defeated forever.
10:47
This Last Judgment/Apocalypse is called frashokereti, meaning “renewal.” As in the renewal of
10:53
Ahura Mazda's originally perfect creation.
10:55
4 The Three G’s
10:57
The most important concept in Zoroastrianism after Ahura Mazda, is Asha.
11:02
This is an ancient Avestan word and is difficult to translate. Asha is truth, wisdom, goodness,
11:08
justice, perfection, order, and progress rolled into one word. Asha is the path of Ahura Mazda.
11:15
Zoroastrians try their best to follow the path of Asha.
11:18
To help humanity follow Asha, Ahura Mazda gave them Vohu Manah or Good Mind. This allowed
11:24
humans to recognise right from wrong. Good Mind lets us see injustice and feel that it
11:30
is unjust. Through Good Mind, Ahura Mazda gave humans free will, this means a lot to
11:36
Zoroastrians because choice is extremely important to their beliefs.
11:40
From our Good Mind we can have Good Thoughts, and from Good Thoughts follow Good Words and
11:45
Good Deeds. Doing Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds is the core of Zoroastrian
11:51
belief.
11:52
Good Deeds such as taking part in your community, supporting others during tough times, standing
11:57
up against injustice, fighting poverty, nursing the sick, and subscribing to educational Youtube
12:02
Channels all help in the battle against Angra Mainyu. This is why in India Zoroatrians are
12:07
known for their support of orphanages, shelters, and many charities.
12:12
Zoroaster said "Happiness comes to them who bring happiness to others."
12:17
5 Fire
12:20
Zoroastrians see fire as the sacred symbol of Ahura Mazda. It is considered to be pure
12:24
and represents the Truth. Inside Zoroastrian Fire temples, their priests conduct all rituals
12:30
in front of fire because it shows the presence of Ahura Mazda. But the fire is never actually
12:36
worshipped itself. This is very important, Zoroastrians do not worship fire! Zoroastrianism
12:43
also isn’t a congressional religion, most worship is done at home and Zoroastrians tend
12:48
to go to Fire Temples only during the 7 Holy Days or festivals they have each year.
12:53
The most sacred fires in Zoroastrianism need to be made up of fire from 16 different sources,
12:59
one of which needs to be ignited by lighting! 6 The Avesta
13:02
The Avesta is the holy book of the Zoroastrians and one of the world’s oldest scriptures.
13:08
It is written in an ancient language known as Avestan which was the language spoken by
13:12
Zoroaster roughly 3500 years ago.
13:16
The Avesta contains hymns from Zoroaster himself known as Gathas. These 17 Gathas are deeply
13:23
important to Zoroastrians and most Zoroastrian belief is based on them. Due to the violence
13:28
Zoroastrians have suffered throughout history only a fraction of the Avesta survives today.
13:33
For example, Zoroastrians believe that when Alexander The Great conquered the Achaemenid
13:37
Empire, he burned the royal Palace at Persepolis and its library to the ground. Destroying
13:42
a complete copy of the Avesta, written in gold on 12,000 goatskins. This might be why
13:49
he isn't called Alexander the Great in Iran, but Alexander The Accursed.
13:54
Even more of the Avesta was lost during the Arab, Turkic and Mongol invasions of Iran.
13:59
Zoroastrians really couldn't catch a break.
14:01
You can read the Avesta online for free and a lot of it is extremely beautiful and thought
14:06
provoking, but if you're a dunce like myself you’ll love this section about how hedgehogs
14:10
known as “The dog with the prickly back” serve Ahura Mazda and turtles have sided with
14:15
Angra Mainyu or the following chapter “Atoning for the murder of a water-dog” which is
14:20
about how you’ll be punished if you kill an otter. So be like the pricklyboi and water
14:24
dog and help fight against evil!
14:27
When the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus The Great, freed the Jews from Babylon
14:32
he not only showed the world the religious tolerance that Zoroastrian rulers would become
14:36
known for, but he changed world history at the same time.
14:39
For freeing the Jews, Cyrus was praised as a messiah in the Book of Isaiah.
14:43
This meant that Jewish thinkers were obviously quite receptive to Zoroastrians and Zoroastrian
14:48
ideas.
14:49
It is in the Book of Isaiah that Yahweh is for the first time spoken of as the Single
14:54
Creator God, like Ahura Mazda.
14:57
The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christanity, and Islam owe a lot to Zoroastrianism. Because
15:02
while Zoroaster’s teaching doesn't really sound too revolutionary today. Ideas like
15:06
one all powerful god, a cosmic battle between a loving god and their satanic nemesis, angels
15:13
and archangels, a heavenly judgement that places a person in heaven or hell, and a final
15:19
cataclysmic judgement that would purify the world and bring about the kingdom of God where
15:24
the good will live in eternal paradise, which is a Persian word. Were all brand new at the
15:29
time. This means that while small today Zoroastrianism has influenced the most sacred beliefs of
15:36
billions of people.
