# Class # 
You are free to select any official (not UA) class and subclass but I would caution against anything that interacts with water, or the weather as those abilities will not work in this setting. 
You are able to use the Custom Lineage options. If you do, please declare the race you are appearing as in your description notes. 

# Spells #
No official spells are banned, BUT you should know that spells that create water or food will not work at levels 1-3. 
For example, you are able to select Goodberry as a spell, but you will not be able to cast it at level 1. 

# Ability Scores #
We will use the standard 27 point, point buy system. 

# Background #
Because of our unusual starting circumstances, no one will be a "Sage" or a "Criminal". 
You should design and name your own background using the official Custom Background rules. 
When you set up your Character in DNDBeyond, the custom option will be the top option in the picklist. 

The "Features" are the benefits you get. 
The "Characteristics" determine suggestions for your personality, ideals, bonds, etc. 

Please choose the ones that make sense for your character. You can reference each one here:

# Starting Equipment #

Do NOT add starting equipment as normal, please instead manually add:
- 1 set of common clothes 
- 1 mess kit
- 1 backpack

- Choose one (1) from your parent:
  - greataxe
  - quarterstaff (also a druidic focus)
  - maul
  - shortsword
  - shortbow and 10 arrows
  - shield with a holy symbol
  - scale mail armor
  - lute
  - thieves tools
  - spellbook
  - components pouch
  - arcane focus

- Choose one (1) from the rubble of your home:
  - A Holy Symbol
  - Horn
  - Crowbar
  - a bottle of black ink and a quill
  - A set of artisanâ€™s tools with which you are proficient

- Choose one (1) from the rubble around the town:
  - Club
  - Greatclub

Yes, this means that you are not starting with many resources you might be used to, such as rations, rope, torches and likely armor. Hopefully, you will find some!

# Feats #
Currently no feats are banned. 

# Character Development #

Character development relies heavily on the player. Please be sure your character has a reason for helping in Farwater. 

# Relationships # 
You will likely be friends with all of other player characters in this game, but you should establish one connection that is especially strong. This can be either with one of the other players, or an established NPC.
